# My 34 keys layout

COPIED FROM DALIUS - SWAPPED OUT MY COLEMAK CONFIG

This are my principles for layout:

* I am using Callum style layout. Here you can read explanation by
  Callum himself and his reasoning for not using mod-tap:
  [here](../../../../users/callum/readme.md)

* There should be only one way to type key. Key can be on
  different layer but it must maintain its physical location.

* The less features are used the better.

* trilayer is cool.

* There is üêç key for no reason.

As well I have added one shot layers compatible with Callum's one
shot keys.

There is simple TMUX layer as well.


Notes: Not sure how trilayer state works - giving it a dhot, will revert to
previous layer approach if not

Used manually flipped colemak config

Try replacing shift with another key to avoid multiple shift keys in a layer
